# VisGit

## Intro
VisGit allows you to view, create and edit Github Issues, Mielstones and Labels from within Visual Studio.



## Getting Started

Get a Public Access Token via `Github > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained Tokens`. 

You'll also need the following Repository Permissions:

`Issues = Read and Write`

`Metadata = Read-only`

In `Visual Studio > Tools > Options > VisGit > Personal Access Token` enter your Personal Access  Token.

## Operational

### Authentication

Your Git Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored using encryption based on your local machine's hardware. Thus, you may need to re-generate and re-enter your PAT if you're having problems following any hardware changes.
